This has been getting more attention later so I cleaned up the code.
Look at and run "Mermin3.java" to see how we solve the measurement problem.  

When measurement has access to a random number generator, local physics can explain
all so-called weird phenomenon.

We simulate here two detectors and a source in an EPR-type experiment.
The goal is to answer Mermin's request that we "find some other 
explanation that arrives at these outcome statistics".  The model is 
locally consistent.

We do two runs: 

One including only cases where the two detectors 
are on the same of three settings,

One where the detectors are on random settings

In all cases we keep only cases where both detectors turn on, either green or red.

Each detector has a chance to turn on proportional to the cosine of the angle 
between the setting direction and the particle spin direction.

The first case produces equal results 100% of the time.  

The second case produces equal results 50% of the time.  

These are the Mermin criteria, in which it is claimed no local physics can describe.  


The extrapolation to all other cases of quantum mechanics is not difficult.
