# mermin-sim

We simulate here two detectors and a source in an EPR-type experiment.
The goal is to answer Mermin's request that we "find some other 
explanation that arrives at these outcome statistics".  The model is 
locally consistent.

We do two runs: 

one including only cases where the two detectors 
are on the same of three settings,

one where the detectors are on random settings

In all cases we keep only cases where both detectors turn on, either green or red.

Each detector has a chance to turn on proportional to the cosine of the angle 
between the setting direction and the particle spin direction.
